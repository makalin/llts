# üöÄ LLTS: Low-Latency Time Sync

A proof-of-concept for a **Decentralized Time Synchronization** tool built with Rust. LLTS provides a peer-to-peer, low-latency method for network nodes to achieve and maintain time consensus, tackling a fundamental and complex problem in distributed systems.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:** No reliance on a central authority or dedicated time server (like NTP). Every node contributes to time synchronization.
  * **Low-Latency Focus:** Algorithms designed specifically to minimize time deviation and communication overhead.
  * **Rust Powered:** Built using **Rust** for performance, memory safety, and concurrency.
  * **Algorithm Agnostic:** Designed to serve as a platform for testing various distributed time synchronization algorithms.

## üí° Why LLTS?

Achieving accurate time synchronization is crucial for distributed ledger technologies, high-frequency trading platforms, and any large-scale distributed system. Traditional methods (like NTP) rely on a hierarchical structure and can be susceptible to network delay and single points of failure. LLTS explores a resilient, decentralized alternative to ensure clock accuracy across a peer network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rust** | Core language for high performance and safety. |
| **Networking** | Handles peer discovery and message passing. |
| **Algorithms** | Implements the core time synchronization logic (e.g., decentralized averaging, clock correction). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Rust** and **Cargo** (Rust's package manager) installed.

```bash
# Check if Rust is installed
rustc --version
# If not installed, get it from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/makalin/llts.git
    cd llts
    ```

2.  Build the project:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Running the Proof-of-Concept

To demonstrate the synchronization, you can run multiple instances of the compiled binary on different terminals. Each instance will attempt to discover and synchronize with its peers.

```bash
# Run Node 1 (using the release binary)
./target/release/llts --port 8080

# Run Node 2 in a new terminal
./target/release/llts --port 8081

# Run Node 3 in a new terminal
./target/release/llts --port 8082
```

*(Note: Command-line arguments (`--port`) are placeholders and should reflect your actual application logic for starting peer nodes.)*

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

The current focus is a functioning proof-of-concept. Future plans include:

  * **Protocol Refinement:** Implementing a robust gossip or consensus-based time protocol.
  * **Peer Discovery:** Adding a more advanced peer discovery service (e.g., mDNS or bootstrap nodes).
  * **Latency Measurement:** Detailed logging and metrics for time drift and synchronization convergence.
  * **Algorithm Testing:** Benchmark different synchronization algorithms against each other.
